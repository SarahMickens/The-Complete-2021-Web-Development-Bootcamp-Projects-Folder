# The-Complete-2021-Web-Development-Bootcamp-Projects-Folder
This is where I store my journey of learning basic full stack developement. I'm utilizing Angela Yu's "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy. 
I'll add completed challenges as I go to not only connect with other students, but to prove that anyone can learn to code and get a real job with hardwork and determination!
